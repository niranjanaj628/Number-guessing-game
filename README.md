# Number-guessing-game
-----------------------
Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! ðŸŽ®

This is a simple Python-based game where the computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and your job is to guess the number. The game features three difficulty levels, each with a different number of attempts.

This is based on the project idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/)

---------------------------------------------------
## Overview
-----------
This project builds a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user has to guess it. The user will be given a limited number of chances to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game will end, and the user will win. Otherwise, the game will continue until the user runs out of chances.

### Instructions for running the file

   Clone the repository
   
   
     git clone https://github.com/niranjanaj628/Number-guessing-game.git
     
### Instructions for playing the game


1. After cloning the repository into your machine, run the python file (game.py) after ensuring that python is installed in your system.

2. You can execute the python file either in any of the python IDEs present in your system or in command prompt.

3. Once the game begins, a welcome message will be visible on the screen and the program will ask you to select a difficulty level for the game. 

4. Depending on the number of attempts, the difficulty levels are: <br>

   1. **Easy**

   2. **Medium**

   3. **Hard**

6. After the difficulty level has been chosen, you can enter your guess between 1-100.

7. The game ends either when you enter the correct guess or when you run out od attempts. 

8. At the end of the game, the time taken for completing the game will be also calculated by the program.

### Requirements 

* Python 3x(Python 3.6 or higher)

### Code structure

* game.py : The python file that contains the whole code.
    
    * Easy, Medium, Hard : Functions to execute the program based on the difficulty level.
    
    * check : Function that checks if the guess is correct and calculates the elapsed time.
